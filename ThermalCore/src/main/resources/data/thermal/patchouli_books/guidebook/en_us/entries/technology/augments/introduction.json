Augments may be applied either in the tinker bench or in the augment panel in the GUI of machines, devices, and dynamos."

      "text": "When hovering over an augment in your inventory, the item tooltip will display the augment's modifiers. Modifiers in normal font can be stacked, additively for those starting with '+' and multiplicatively for those ending in 'x'. Multipliers in bold cannot be stacked; instead, only the highest multiplier of all the augments is used. For example, a machine with both $(l:thermal:technology/augments/rf_coil_storage)Stabilized RF Coil$(/l) and $(l:thermal:technology/augments/rf_coil_xfer)High-Flux RF Coil$(/l) augments will have a total of 6x RF storage and 6x RF transfer."
